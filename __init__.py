__init__.py

This file marks the directory as a Python package and can be used to initialize package-level
variables, import commonly used components, or define package metadata.

In this project, it may serve the following purposes:
- Define package-level constants or configuration.
- Expose key classes or functions for easier imports.
- Initialize shared resources or game-wide settings.

This file is optional unless specific initialization logic is required.
